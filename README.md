# 📚 Student Notes Portal

A simple, clean, and motivating platform built by seniors to help juniors access **Notes**, **Previous Year Question Papers (PYQs)**, and essential academic resources across all engineering departments.

This project is lightweight, fully responsive, and easy to host on **GitHub Pages**. It is also expandable — you can keep adding more resources without changing the structure.
